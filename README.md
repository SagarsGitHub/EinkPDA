# [Project Summary]
  This project is a PDA powered by an ESP32-S3 running a custom OS written in C++ using PlatformIO. This project utilizes an E-Ink and OLED screen in tandem to mitigate the refresh rate restrictions of an E-Ink panel while retaining the aesthetics and benefits of using E-Ink. This project is a work in progress and currently amounts to a simple GUI for navigating between apps, a text (.txt) file editor, and a basic file manager.

  This is a forked repository specifically for maintaining an obsolete version of the device (V2). My main focus will be adding as much functionality from the current device (v3).

# [TO-DO]
- Calendar app
- internal esp32 RTC support
- Calculator app
